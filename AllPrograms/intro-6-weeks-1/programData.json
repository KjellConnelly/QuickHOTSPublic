  "md":"If this is your very first time doing **DBT**, or you are just fairly new to it, here is a good place to start. Do all of the *6-Week Intro Programs* before you move onto the next ones, as each 6-week program will go over Mindfulness and one other category of skills.\n\nIn this program, the first two weeks will focus on becoming more *self-aware* and *mindful* of yourself. The next four weeks, we will work on *Communication Skills* which involve being more effective in our interactions with others."
