Each program will focus on a limited number of topics in order to help you dive deep enough become more competent, but not so deep that you get lost.\n\nWe recognize that learning is best done in short organized bursts over longer periods of time. For this reason, we suggest you *stick to the weekly schedule*, and try to do no more than one lesson per day. Some weeks may have you doing 6 more compacted lessons, whereas others will be as little as 3. We know that life can get in the way of a routine, so feel free to pause and continue your lesson any time, day or night. All you need is an internet connection and a subscription.\n\nThe rest of the exercises in this Program are more informational, so feel free to skip them if you just want to learn DBT!",
